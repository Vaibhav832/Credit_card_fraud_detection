# 💳 Credit Card Fraud detection using Machine Learning 

## 📝 Problem Statement:
Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the
incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the
biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The
goal is to predict the probability of credit fault based on credit card owner's
characteristics and payment history.

## 💭 Approach:
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Trying out different machine
learning algorithms that best fit for the above case.

## 📈 Results: 
Built a solution that is able to predict the probability of credit
card fault based on transaction features.<br>
Deployed the application on AWS BeanStalk.
